Lights, camera, code! Our project revolves around building a web application that displays movie ratings and allows you to dive into some fascinating analytics. Whether you're a cinephile or just looking for your next movie night pick, this web app has got you covered! 😄🍕

## Datasets

We've curated a selection of datasets to power our movie magic:
